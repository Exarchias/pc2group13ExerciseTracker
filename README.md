# Exercise Tracker

#### *Project Couse 2*

###### *TBSEH: Bachelor program in Software Development*

*4th April - 5th June 2019*

### Introduction

 An essential part of a student’s life is the habit of regular workout. The stressful life of a student could
affect some of the good habits that the student may possess. So, the custom of regular exercise should
then be taken into consideration, and therefore we decided to create a fitness tracker, or more
specifically as we call it, an “Exercise Tracker”. The application is not designed to work with smart
devices, so it requires the personal involvement of the user. That makes the user be more involved
with their schedule and hopefully helps them to be more dedicated to their workout as well. In order to
allow the user to make the best use of the application; it saves the exercises to a database and it can
display the data of the exercises and even give a written analysis of how the user is doing with their
fitness. To respect the user’s privacy, we offer state-of-the-art security with considered unbreakable
encryption and sane and solid login procedure.

There are two roles on the application User and Admin, who have distinct access to the system. The
Admin can manage the users while the User is able to manage the exercises in order to make use of
them as they need. The Admin should be able to create new users, delete users, or update them, while
the User should be able to add, remove and update exercises as they see fit.

Important elements of the program are—its connectivity with a remote database system and industry
grade encryption. Specifically, the password should be stored in an encrypted form, and the resetting
of the password should be done by following the standard procedure that the most Content
Management Systems are following (using Email system). Furthermore, the application is expected to
send emails and print a PDF report of the desired data.
